Don’t know what [“LiveSplit”](https://livesplit.org) is? It allows you to time speedruns of your favourite games!

Based up on the LiveSplit files created by [alterNERDtive](https://github.com/alterNERDtive/LiveSplit-Elite-Magic-8-Ball-Championship) for the Magic 8-Ball Championship 

## Setup

3. Launch LiveSplit and do the following:
   - Right click, Open Splits, select `[name of the race].lss`.
   - Right click, Open Layout, select `[name of the race].lsl`.
   - Right click, Edit Layout, Layout Settings, then in “Scriptable Auto Splitter”, set `[name of the race].asl` as the script path.

## Races

### Race 3 – Tunnel-ish Vision

<https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-buckyball-racing-club-presents-tunnel-ish-vision-swift-16-championship-race-3.617429/>

The AutoSplitter will start the timer once you undock from Gaensler Station. 

Since the order in which you visit the race’s stops is up to you, the splits do not have a specific order and instead just list the `n`th stop.
**Note:** Splits will be triggered if you drop out near the orbiting body instead of at the Installations/Captial Ships. For example if you crash into the planet.

### Race 2 – The Empire Hustle

The AutoSplitter will start the timer once you undock from Artemis Lodge.

Since you can pick any Thargoid sites, after collecting the sensor the splits will be based on landing and leaving the Thargoid sites rather than normal jump to system ones until you get back to Celaeno.


### Race 1 – The Empire Hustle

The AutoSplitter will start the timer once you undock from Agnews` Folly. 

Since the order in which you visit the race’s stops is up to you, the splits do not have a specific order and instead just list the `n`th stop.
